# Haste Broken Worlds Demo Mod Repository

## How do I download a single mod?
Navigate to the mod which you'd like to download and click on the mod's `.dll` file and on the right side of your screen there should be a download icon. If the mod includes assetbundles or other dlls then it may be easier to download each individuially or the whole repository depending how you'd like to do it.

## How do I add my mod?

 1. Fork the repository. (If you press the `.` key you can enter a VS code editor on your web browser and update from there.)
 2. Create a folder in the base directory with your mod name.
 3. Create a readme in your folder.
 4. Create a folder for each version and optionally a folder for a latest version so it would look something like

```
ExampleMod/
├─ v1.2/
│  ├─ example_mod.dll
├─ v1.1/
│  ├─ example_mod.dll
├─ v1.0/
│  ├─ example_mod.dll
├─ latest/ (optional)
│  ├─ example_mod.dll
├─ README.md

```

5. Create a pull request. (optionally ping me in the Haste server @anthony.stai)
