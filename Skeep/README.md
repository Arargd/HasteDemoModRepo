# Skeep (BepInEx Mod)  

### What It Does  
This mod skips the intro and demo in *Haste* and takes you straight to the hub world. No waiting—just play.  

### How to Install  
1. Make sure **BepInEx** is installed.  
2. Drop `Skeep.dll` into `BepInEx/plugins/`.  
3. Start the game—boom, no more intro!  

### Compatibility  
- Works with the latest *Haste* update.  
- Should be fine with other mods unless they mess with the startup.
